PR_TIP_0    As a squad leader or mortar operator, range values to your markers are automatically calculated for you in your squad command screen (Default key: CAPSLOCK).
PR_TIP_1    A Squad Leader (SL) can setup a Rally Point (RP) to keep the squad together. The squad leader will need an officer kit and two members of the squad present to place this important asset.
PR_TIP_2    Found a bug in Project Reality? Go to realitymod.com and post it in the "PR Bugs" section of the forums to help us fix it.
PR_TIP_3    Squad communication is the key to success for a good squad and a good game. Ensure you have a microphone to maximize your squad's effectiveness as well as your Project Reality experience.
PR_TIP_4    Check your map to locate your objectives. Staying informed with the latest intel is a key element on the battlefield.
PR_TIP_5    Disobedience is a greatly frowned upon. Don't shoot or reveal your position until your squad leader says so.
PR_TIP_6    Commanders have the ability to deploy a team rally point, which requires a minimum of 12 players in the team, at least 6 players close (2 of them being Squad Leaders).
PR_TIP_7    If your Squad Leader (SL) does not assign you a specific kit, do the squad a favor and observe your squads current kit load out. Fill the role that the squad lacks for its current objectives.
PR_TIP_8    Ammunition and supplies on the battlefield are scarce, so having a rifleman in the squad to carry extra ammunition is always essential.
PR_TIP_9    Combat Medics are a vital part in maintaining a squad at full battle condition during operations.
PR_TIP_10   Your first priority when joining the battle should be regrouping with the rest of your squad. Find your squad and stick with them. Moving out alone without a goal on the battlefield will make you an easy target.
PR_TIP_11   Deploy your Squad Rally Point (RP) in a safe position that can be reinforced by friendly units. Use the rally point to your advantage in firefights where you need to widthdraw and regroup.
PR_TIP_12   When designating a landing zone for transport helicopters, remember that a two minute walk from a safe landing zone is better than a metal coffin in a hot LZ - plan carefully before calling that extract.
PR_TIP_13   Do not abandon vehicles in the field. When parking a vehicle, always park it near a friendly Forward Outpost or Rally Point. Remember that before complaining about not having any transport available and explain to your team why you decide to abandon your vehicle.
PR_TIP_14   Covering or Suppressive fire is extremely effective at keeping the enemies head down and keeping your squad alive and mobile - Use it!
PR_TIP_15   Repair Crews should NOT initiate vehicle repairs in the middle of combat. Designate a safe area to fall back to in order to receive vehicle repairs. Repairs take time and leave vehicles exposed so plan accordingly.
PR_TIP_16   Upon taking an objective, communicate with your team to organize a defence. Bracing for the enemy counterattack is just as, if not more important than making the assault.
PR_TIP_17   One wounded, one medic. The number of medics healing a single soldier is directly proportional to the number of grenades that will land in the area.
PR_TIP_18   Please exercise restraint when using the door guns on transport helicopters. Shooting for no reason wastes ammunition, gives your position away and annoys the pilot.
PR_TIP_19   While manning fixed machine guns and other stationary equipment, try changing your view point (default key: "C") to bring the enemy into your fire effectively.
PR_TIP_20   Avoid being seen by the enemy wherever possible. Keeping out of sight means the enemy will be unable to track your position, and will give your squad the initiative when a firefight breaks out.
PR_TIP_21   Killing the enemy is only one small aspect of the battlefield, always keep the team's primary objective in mind.
PR_TIP_22   Keep your spacing! When bunched up, one machine gun, grenade or even worse one booby trap can decimate the entire squad.
PR_TIP_23   Mortars and timed Area attack weapons (JDAM, Artillery) are excellent support powers that can clear and suppress enemy positions so your team can assault them. It also provides a thick dust plume that your forces can utilize to traverse the battelfield.
PR_TIP_24   Extraction/Insertion points should provide cover to both the squad and the vehicle. Hilltops are not ideal for this purpose.
PR_TIP_25   Joining a specialised squad (such as a transport chopper squad or armor squad) means that you should be crewing/supporting those vehicles, not going off fighting your own wars.
PR_TIP_26   If you cannot kill it, leave it alone or it will kill you.
PR_TIP_27   Use grenades, rifle grenades or rockets to clear out enemy positions such as bunkers/houses BEFORE moving inside to reduce friendly casualties.
PR_TIP_28   Underbarrel Grenade Launchers and most missile systems have a minimum arming distance of aproximately 30-50m before arming.
PR_TIP_29   Spot first, shoot later. If you spot a possible contact, inform the squad what you've sighted. Identify what it is, the range to the target and the bearing on your compass. Also state whether the target has spotted you or not.
PR_TIP_30   Flying aircraft in Project Reality is not for the faint of heart. Do not attempt to fly a jet or helicopter in a populated server without getting some practice flight time in first. Try a local or PRSP Co-Op Server to get a handle on flying.
PR_TIP_31   Always apologize for Friendly Fire. Accidents do happen in the best of circumstances and saying sorry is just good manners.
PR_TIP_32   Always stay clear of a friendly vehicle's rear area, even during repairs. If the driver needs to reverse in a hurry you might become an unintended victim of their hasty retreat.
PR_TIP_33   When leading a squad, don't be afraid to tell individual members of the squad what you need them to do in order to accomplish your objectives.
PR_TIP_34   When moving across an obstacle in your path such as a road or river, ensure there is always someone covering the squad as they traverse the obstacle.
PR_TIP_35   When creating a squad, giving it the appropriate name for what you will be doing is appreciated by your team commander as well as other squad leaders. Examples: INF, MECHINF, ARMOR, CAS, TRANSPORT etc.
PR_TIP_36   Avoid grabbing your favorite marksman or sniper kit from the nearest vehicle needlessly. Always check first with your Squad Leader before requesting it.
PR_TIP_37   Mortars require a fire mission to be called by the forward observer before they can be operated. The fire mission marker will be a mortar crew's intended target of which they will base their fire calculations off.
PR_TIP_38   Using automatic or burst fire with any small arm is best left for close quarters combat. Use semi-automatic for targets that are greater than 50m away.
PR_TIP_39   Breachers, Scouts and Point-men are kits which role aids the squad in scaling walls, breaching obstacles and light asset demolition.
PR_TIP_40   As a squad leader do not be afraid to make decisions and take action! If an attack isn't working, find another way around.
PR_TIP_41   Constantly scanning your surroundings is key on the battlefield. Be aware that when engaging the enemy you'll inevitibly be sucked into a kind of 'tunnel vision' that you need to break out of to maintain your situational awareness.
PR_TIP_42   Check your map when necessary. Note the locations of friendly squads/troops, and objectives that are undefended before moving on.
PR_TIP_43   Make very sure of your target before opening fire. Study the silhouettes, weapons and camouflage patterns of your enemy to help in recognition.
PR_TIP_44   Rambo did not have to worry about hitting his targets on the run - You do. Stop moving and adopt a crouching or prone position to greatly increase the chance of hitting your target.
PR_TIP_45   Smoke is best deployed between you and the enemy. Some Vehicles also have smoke grenade launchers that can disperse smoke over a large area almost instantly.
PR_TIP_46   Creating a squad dedicated to logistics and construction is a highly valuable asset for any Commander. Use this squad to shuttle troops and supplies to the frontline and construct both defensive and offensive forward outposts.
PR_TIP_47   The problem with the easy way in is that it has already been booby trapped.
PR_TIP_48   Ideally the assaulting team in a flanking manoeuvre should not be seen by the defending enemy during their approach. Make good use of contours in the land, vegetation, and buildings and try to use smoke cover to your advantage.
PR_TIP_49   Call retreats often and early. Never, ever, try to force an attack. If it looks like it isn't going to work, pull your men out of there immediately and try a different plan. It can also confuse the enemy if you do it right.
PR_TIP_50   Light Machine Guns (LMGs), Medium Machine Guns (MMGs/GPMGs) Designated Marksman Rifles (DMRs) and Sniper Rifles are best used from a stationary position in deployed mode.
PR_TIP_51   Most medium to heavy vehicles and aircraft have access to thermal imaging (FLIR) capabilities. Use this to quickly identify potential targets and to aid in gathering intelligence for your team.
PR_TIP_52   Combat Engineers are key in bridge and asset demolition, setting up perimeter defenses, laying mines and booby traps as well as defusing them.
PR_TIP_53   Keep below ridge-lines when moving over open ground. Your silhouette against the skyline will make you an easy target.
PR_TIP_54   Some Designated Marksman Rifles have different magnification settings that are dependant on which mode (Undeployed/Deployed) you are in.
PR_TIP_55   As a Crewman remember what your high priority threats will be: enemy Armor, mobile AT vehicles, AT Infantry in close quarters, and aircraft. These should be engaged on your own terms or avoided if possible.
PR_TIP_56   All soldiers are issued a field dressing to help stop the bleeding of minor wounds. If you were badly wounded then seek out a combat medic after applying the dressing.
PR_TIP_57   Infantry and Forward Outpost defence emplacements can rearm from ammo bags carried by Riflemen, who in turn can be resupplied by supply crates deployed by Trucks, Jeeps and APCs. Vehicles can rearm from the Vehicle Supply Depot located in your main base or primary landing site.
PR_TIP_58   Light Anti-Tank weapons such as the M136 AT4, M72 LAW, RPG-7, or the RPG26 are not effective against Main Battle Tanks. Use the Heavy Anti-Tank kit for that role. When engaging armor, aim for the weaker tank armor located at the rear or top of the MBT, or its tracks.
PR_TIP_59   When you can see the enemy, the enemy can see you.
PR_TIP_60   Anti-Tank and Anti-Air weapon systems take a considerable time to setup and deploy. During this process, you cannot fire the weapon so plan ahead when getting ready to fire.
PR_TIP_61   IEDs, Landmines, C4 and Claymores are excellent area denial weapons and also great for ambushes. However be mindful that they cannot tell the difference between friend and foe, so warn friendlies when setting up these powerful explosives using the commo rose.
PR_TIP_62   Don't get upset if a pilot doesn't agree to drop you somewhere. It is the pilot's helicopter and he will do what is necessary to keep it alive.
PR_TIP_63   To use the kit request system you must be in a squad first and then use the squad commo rose (default key: "T") to request it.
PR_TIP_64   All armored and some specialist role vehicles require a Crewman kit to operate so make sure you have one if you intend to operate them.
PR_TIP_65   All aircraft require a Pilot kit to operate, so make sure you have one if you intend to fly. In addition it is the only kit that is issued a parachute for emergencies.
PR_TIP_66   Remember, tracers work both ways. They help you guide your bullets to your target but they also help the enemies guide themselves to you. Unconventional factions, pistols, marksman rifles and sniper rifles do not employ tracer ammunition.
PR_TIP_67   Parachutes require a minimum deploy distance in the air, approximately 300 meters. Be sure to pull your parachute with plenty of space between you and the ground or your parachute will not deploy properly and you will not survive to tell the tale.
PR_TIP_68   Most armored vehicles have different types of rounds available. Use the switch weapon key (default key: "F") to switch between the different rounds.
PR_TIP_69   IEDs and Anti-Personnel Mines have equipped two separate chains of detonation. Use this system to setup more complex ambushes with two stages of explosives.
PR_TIP_70   All air vehicles have an engine startup time before they are capable of getting airborne. Attempting to take off before the engines are fully operational will endanger the aircraft and your fellow soldiers in and around it.
PR_TIP_71   The Designated Marksman kit is used to provide accurate, long-range fire for your squad. Stay close to your fellow squad members as they are relying on you to provide that much needed support.
PR_TIP_72   Scouting squads provide intel for the commander and your team about enemy troop movements. Snipers should always operate with an accompanying Spotter to provide security, maneuverability and an additional pair of eyes.
PR_TIP_73   If your vehicle has become disabled and you're unable to move or fire, you will need to call for a repair crew to repair the damage before you can effectively operate the vehicle again.
PR_TIP_74   The Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) role is to provide safe transport for infantry, and provide fire support for those passengers. Stick close to your infantry squads to support them. APCs are NOT an effective asset to use against heavily armored targets like Main Battle Tanks or Aircraft.
PR_TIP_75   When moving with your squad be sure to watch different arcs. Avoid all looking in the same direction as you can easily be flanked. You can increase the squad's awareness by observing all compass directions.
PR_TIP_76   Squad Leaders can call in a contact report to the commander to report enemy movements via their Radio.
PR_TIP_77   Find out more information about Project Reality at www.realitymod.com
PR_TIP_78   To build a Forward Outpost and Fire Support emplacements you require Supply Crates. These are dropped by Logistics Trucks and Transport Helicopters with the right-mouse button (default key).
PR_TIP_79   Supply crates come in two flavors. One Heavy Supply Crate is required to deploy a Forward Outpost, Two to deploy emplacements. Light Supply Crates are half the supply value of their heavy counterparts.
PR_TIP_80   Always be on the alert for places to take cover as it will drastically increase your life expectancy during a firefight.
PR_TIP_81   When receiving medical aid be sure to cover the medic that is treating you. Ask the same from squad mates when you are the medic treating the wounded.
PR_TIP_82   If a fellow squad member is bleeding you can use your own field dressing on them to help stabilise the bleeding until a combat medic arrives.
PR_TIP_83   Effective fire onto an enemies position will keep him disorientated and suppressed. Use this suppression to win the firefight, keeping your opponent's heads down while you send a flanking team to assault and clear the position.
PR_TIP_84   Officers and Snipers carry a GLTD - Ground Laser Target Designator (default key: "7") which can be used to lase targets and call in fire support. Press Left Mouse Button (default key) to designate a laser target.
PR_TIP_85   Avoid spending too much time on one target for too long. Doing so will pull you into a kind of tunnel vision and your situational awareness will dramaticly drop.
PR_TIP_86   When using Machine Guns, fire in controlled 3 to 5 rounds bursts for highly accurate fire. Avoid using continous automatic fire as you will not be able clearly identify where your fire is landing.
PR_TIP_87   When operating attack helicopters always ensure you have a co-pilot/gunner. Likewise when operating heavy vehicles that you always have a gunner.
PR_TIP_88   Remember, two is better than one. Moving in groups enables teammates to quickly respond for additional support. This is true with all aspects of the battlefield.
PR_TIP_89   The longest way is often the safest way. Do not always take the most direct route at the enemy as you may quite likely succumb to accurate defensive fire.
PR_TIP_90   When attacking an objective one of your first goals should be eliminating enemy reinforcements: rally points and forward outposts. It will be very difficult to capture or destroy your objective until you have disrupted your enemy reinforcement routes.
PR_TIP_91   Breachers, Scouts, Pointmen and Civilians are issued a grappling hook. Use this useful tool to overcome obstacles and difficult terrain.
PR_TIP_92   Speed, Stealth, Skill. As a Commander, Squad Leader or Squad Member, you want to combine these elements on the battlefield to maximise your overall efficiency. Move quickly, move silently and strike precisely.
PR_TIP_93   Infantry squads should work together with APC squads wherever possible. Not only does this increase your squad's mobility, but by working with an APC squad it will increase your squads firepower and ammunition reserves while operating as a full six man squad.
PR_TIP_94   Mounted heavy machine guns typically found on jeeps are best used from a distance as moving in to close range makes the gunner vulnerable to flanking manouvres. They are frighteningly accurate, highly lethal and extremely intimidating.
PR_TIP_95   When driving keep in mind the roads are the safest and quickest route (depending on the situation). Driving off road in a truck means you risk getting stuck or rolling over on the rough terrain.
PR_TIP_96   Underbarrel Grenade Launchers and some Anti-Tank missile systems have a simple sight adjustment system (default key: "Q") that requires the user to know the range to the target before firing.
PR_TIP_97   When referring to the map use the grid coordinates system. Example: E3kp3. E3 is the sector, kp3 is the "keypad" sector within E3. Refer to the top left sector for a keypad guide.
PR_TIP_98   Squad Leaders remember to keep the commander and your team up to date on your situation. That way air support can soften your advance, armour squads can oversee your movement, and other friendly squads will have the power to coordinate with you in attacking.
PR_TIP_99   When using the map to judge distances on a diagonal, Pythagoras is your best friend: A^2 plus B^2 equals C^2.
